InterFits
=========

Interfits is a python package for converting and reading radio interferometric data. It can read
UV-FITS and FITS-IDI, and also reads two FITS-IDI inspired data formats: JSON-IDI and HDF5-IDI.
InterFits can export data tables in JSON-IDI, FITS-IDI or HDF5-IDI.

Additionally, the LedaFits class reads the raw file formats used in the LEDA project (http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/LEDA/),
and contains methods for combining and computing observational metadata (e.g. LST and UVW coordinate calculation).

InterFits comes with a basic data viewer, called QtUv. This can open and display the raw data for any data type that
can be read by InterFits.
